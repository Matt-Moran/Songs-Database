# SongsDatabase
This database uses Python to connect to a MongoDB database. This sample database includes a collection of songs that can be queried using the Python code.
This code can be easily replicated for your own MongoDB database.

This repository includes the Python file, the JSON file of the songs, and a mp4 video that serves as a walkthrough of the database.

This was created in my Advanced Database Management Systems class at Providence College.
